*TripGenie – AI-Powered Travel Planner*
TripGenie is an AI-driven travel assistant that generates personalized itineraries based on user preferences such as destination, interests, budget, and travel duration. It combines language model capabilities with real-time data, function calling, and context retrieval to offer intelligent and reliable trip planning.

*Project Overview*
TripGenie enables users to plan trips through natural language queries. It uses advanced prompting techniques, integrates contextual knowledge using retrieval mechanisms, and structures the results in a way that can be used directly in applications or interfaces. The system is designed to minimize planning effort while maximizing personalization and accuracy.

*Core Components*
System Prompt
The system prompt sets the behavior and tone of the language model, instructing it to act as a travel planning assistant. It ensures that all responses stay relevant to travel, are informative, and adhere to safety guidelines.

User Prompt
The user prompt is the input provided by the end-user in natural language, such as a request to plan a trip, suggest activities, or stay within a specific budget. The model uses this prompt to understand the user’s intent and preferences.

Tuning Parameters
Parameters such as temperature, top_p, and max_tokens are adjusted to control the style, creativity, and completeness of the model's responses. These parameters allow customization depending on the use case (e.g., concise output for APIs or detailed plans for users).

Structured Output
TripGenie produces its output in a structured format (typically JSON), which includes clearly separated fields for destination, duration, activities, cost estimation, and daily plans. This allows for seamless integration into user interfaces or mobile applications.

Function Calling
The system uses predefined functions to fetch dynamic or external information such as weather forecasts, hotel listings, and local events. The model can decide when to call these functions during the response generation process, enhancing the accuracy and usefulness of the output.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
TripGenie incorporates RAG to retrieve relevant context from a vectorized knowledge base consisting of travel articles, blogs, and guides. This enhances the model's ability to provide location-specific recommendations and up-to-date travel information.

In this project I have worked on creating a basic interface for TripGenie App.

First, I set up a React project and then installed and configured Tailwind CSS for styling. After that, I went to the App.jsx file and created a very simple interface where I displayed the text "Hello Tripgenie" on the screen. This was done to confirm that our setup is working properly and everything is running fine.

While designing my prompt for this project, I made use of the RTFC framework:

Role – I defined the system role as a project guide that will help me in step-by-step development.

Task – I clearly gave the task which was to create a React interface with Tailwind CSS and display "Hello Tripgenie".

Format – I asked for the code in a structured way so that I can directly implement it inside my project files.

Constraints – I mentioned that the code should be simple and beginner-friendly since this is the starting step of our project.

After completing this part, I pushed the project to GitHub and created a Pull Request so that my progress is tracked properly.

Through this task, I have learned how to:

Set up a project with React and Tailwind CSS,

Write a clean interface inside App.jsx,

Use the RTFC framework to create effective prompts, and

Push code changes to GitHub with a Pull Request.

This is the first milestone of the TripGenie project and I will continue building on top of this.

Thank you.
